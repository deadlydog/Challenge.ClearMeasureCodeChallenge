# Clear Measure Code Challenge

## 💬 Description

This is my solution to the Clear Measure Code Challenge.

The challenge is to create a NuGet package for others to consume that:

- Returns back a list of strings based on the number of items specified, where the string corresponds to the item's index.
- Allows the consumer to specify a list of number-string pairs, where if the index is divisible by the number, the string is returned instead of the index.
- If the index is divisible by more than one number, the strings are concatenated together in the order they were provided.

We also want to create a build script that can be used to build the NuGet package and run tests locally.
